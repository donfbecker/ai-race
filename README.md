This started as a racing game in flash.  I never finished it, and it instead became a platform for me to play with AI.

**Basic AI (not really AI)**

```console
lime test html
lime test linux
lime test [TARGET]
```

**NEAT AI**

```console
lime test html -D neat
lime test linux -D neat
lime test [TARGET] -D neat
```

**QLearning (not complete, just experimenting)**

```console
lime test html -D qlearning
lime test linux -D qlearning
lime test [TARGET] -D qlearning
```

The NEAT version can be viewed at https://games.betatestingsite.com/neat-race/
